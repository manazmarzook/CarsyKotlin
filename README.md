# CarsyKotlin

App Developed as a learning tool

**Carsy** is a mobile application designed to help users track their vehicle's fuel consumption and expenses. The app shows data about each fill-up, including the amount of fuel purchased and the price. **Carsy** can then calculate your fuel economy and provide detailed statistics about your vehicle's usage and expenses over time. In addition to tracking fuel consumption, the app can also track other vehicle-related expenses, such as maintenance and repairs, insurance, and car washes.
